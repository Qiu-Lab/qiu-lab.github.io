Interfaces based on cryogenic cavity electro-optic systems are particularly promising, due to the direct interaction between microwave and optical fields in the quantum regime. Quantum optical control of superconducting microwave circuits has been precluded so far due to the weak electro-optical coupling as well as quasi-particles induced by the pump laser. Here we report the coherent control of a superconducting microwave cavity using laser pulses in a multimode electro-optical device at millikelvin temperature with near-unity cooperativity. Both the stationary and instantaneous responses of the microwave and optical modes comply with the coherent electro-optical interaction, and reveal only minuscule amount of excess back-action with an unanticipated time delay. Our demonstration enables wide ranges of applications beyond quantum transductions, from squeezing and quantum non-demolition measurements of microwave fields, to entanglement generation and hybrid quantum networks.","tags":null,"title":"Coherent Optical Control of a Superconducting Microwave Cavity via Electro-Optical Dynamical Back-Action","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.

Sharing this fragile property between superconducting microwave circuits and optical or atomic systems would enable new functionalities, but this has been hindered by an energy scale mismatch of $\u003e$104 and the resulting mutually imposed loss and noise. In this work, we created and verified entanglement between microwave and optical fields in a millikelvin environment. Using an optically pulsed superconducting electro-optical device, we show entanglement between propagating microwave and optical fields in the continuous variable domain. This achievement not only paves the way for entanglement between superconducting circuits and telecom wavelength light, but also has wide-ranging implications for hybrid quantum networks in the context of modularization, scaling, sensing, and cross-platform verification.","tags":null,"title":"Entangling Microwaves with Light","type":"publication"},{"authors":["QIU LAB"],"categories":null,"content":" Our Lab Website is Now Created!\nQuantum Interference Uncertainty John Wheeler No phenomenon is a physical phenomenon until it is an observed phenomenon.

Here, a new mechanism for preparing stationary entanglement between microwave and optical cavity fields in a cavity optomagnomechanical system is proposed. It consists of a magnon mode in a ferrimagnetic crystal that couples directly to a microwave cavity mode via the magnetic dipole interaction and indirectly to an optical cavity through the deformation displacement of the crystal. The mechanical displacement is induced by the magnetostrictive force and coupled to the optical cavity via radiation pressure. Both the opto- and magnomechanical couplings are dispersive. Magnon--phonon entanglement is created via magnomechanical parametric down-conversion, which is further distributed to optical and microwave photons via simultaneous optomechanical beamsplitter interaction and electromagnonic state-swap interaction, yielding stationary microwave-optics entanglement. The microwave-optics entanglement is robust against thermal noise, which will find broad potential applications in quantum networks and quantum information processing with hybrid quantum systems.","tags":null,"title":"Microwave-Optics Entanglement Via Cavity Optomagnomechanics","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"https://www.qiu-lab.org/research/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://www.qiu-lab.org/contact/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://www.qiu-lab.org/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"https://www.qiu-lab.org/tour/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tour/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tour","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Liu Qiu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1663246800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663246800,"objectID":"f6095ce580061d2e37d58d33690d4e4a","permalink":"https://www.qiu-lab.org/event/2022_09_12_copenhagen/","publishdate":"2022-09-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/2022_09_12_copenhagen/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Entangling microwave and optical photons","type":"event"},{"authors":["Liu Qiu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1662037200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662037200,"objectID":"bd4253fa4e0aa04d34c834c87f89cd07","permalink":"https://www.qiu-lab.org/event/2022_09_15_superqulan/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/2022_09_15_superqulan/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Towards Quantum Network for Superconducting Circuits","type":"event"},{"authors":["Liu Qiu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1655298000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655298000,"objectID":"9c4ae4d91b4af083e586daca959ce817","permalink":"https://www.qiu-lab.org/event/2022_06_12_erlangen/","publishdate":"2022-06-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/2022_06_12_erlangen/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Quantum Entanglement between microwave and optical photons","type":"event"},{"authors":["Liu Qiu","Guanhao Huang","Itay Shomroni","Jiahe Pan","Paul Seidler","Tobias J.

The dissipative photon loss via absorption, present to some extent in any optical cavity, is known to introduce thermo-optical effects and thereby impose fundamental limits on precision measurements. Here, we theoretically and experimentally reveal that such dissipative photon absorption can result in quantum feedback via in-loop field detection of the absorbed optical field, leading to the intracavity field fluctuations to be squashed or antisquashed. A closed-loop dissipative quantum feedback to the cavity field arises. Strikingly, this modifies the optical cavity susceptibility in coherent response measurements (capable of both increasing or decreasing the bare cavity linewidth) and causes excess noise and correlations in incoherent interferometric optomechanical measurements using a cavity, that is parametrically coupled to a mechanical oscillator. We experimentally observe such unanticipated dissipative dynamics in optomechanical spectroscopy of sideband-cooled optomechanical crystal cavitiess at both cryogenic temperature (approximately 8 K) and ambient conditions. The dissipative feedback introduces effective modifications to the optical cavity linewidth and the optomechanical scattering rate and gives rise to excess imprecision noise in the interferometric quantum measurement of mechanical motion. Such dissipative feedback differs fundamentally from a quantum nondemolition feedback, e.g., optical Kerr squeezing. The dissipative feedback itself always results in an antisqueezed out-of-loop optical field, while it can enhance the coexisting Kerr squeezing under certain conditions. Our result applies to cavity spectroscopy in both optical and superconducting microwave cavities, and equally applies to any dissipative feedback mechanism of different bandwidth inside the cavity. It has wide-ranging implications for future dissipation engineering, such as dissipation enhanced sideband cooling and Kerr squeezing, quantum frequency conversion, and nonreciprocity in photonic systems.","tags":null,"title":"Dissipative Quantum Feedback in Measurements Using a Parametrically Coupled Microcavity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liu Qiu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1646744400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646744400,"objectID":"01b3353ffa16569479d7ebbd899ef89f","permalink":"https://www.qiu-lab.org/event/2022_03_12_aps/","publishdate":"2022-03-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/2022_03_12_aps/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Dynamical control in cavity electro-optics","type":"event"},{"authors":["Rishabh Sahu","William Hease","Alfredo Rueda","Georg Arnold","Liu Qiu","Johannes M.

For these experiments, the mechanical oscillator should be prepared in its ground state, i.e., exhibit negligible residual excess motion compared to its zero-point motion. This can be achieved using the radiation pressure of laser light in the cavity by selectively driving the lower motional sideband, leading to sideband cooling. To date, the preparation of sideband-resolved optical systems to their zero-point energy has eluded laser cooling because of strong optical absorption heating. The alternative method of passive cooling suffers from the same problem, as the requisite milliKelvin environment is incompatible with the strong optical driving needed by many quantum protocols. Here, we employ a highly sideband-resolved silicon optomechanical crystal in a 3He buffer-gas environment at $sim$2 K to demonstrate laser sideband cooling to a mean thermal phonon occupancy of 0.09+0.02-0.01 quantum (self-calibrated using motional sideband asymmetry), which is -7.4 dB of the oscillator's zero-point energy and corresponds to 92% ground state probability. Achieving such low occupancy by laser cooling opens the door to a wide range of quantum-optomechanical experiments in the optical domain.","tags":null,"title":"Laser Cooling of a Nanomechanical Oscillator to Its Zero-Point Energy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Itay Shomroni","Liu Qiu","Tobias J.

From sideband cooling and backaction-evading measurements to ponderomotive and mechanical squeezing to entanglement and motional sideband asymmetry. In many protocols, such as dissipative mechanical squeezing, multiple lasers are utilized, giving rise to periodically driven optomechanical systems. Here we show that in this case Floquet dynamics can arise due to presence of Kerr-type nonlinearities, which are ubiquitous in optomechanical systems. Specifically, employing multiple probe tones, we perform sideband asymmetry measurements, a macroscopic quantum effect, on a silicon optomechanical crystal sideband cooled to 40% ground-state occupation. We show that the Floquet dynamics, resulting from the presence of multiple pump tones, gives rise to an artificially modified motional sideband asymmetry by redistributing thermal and quantum fluctuations among the initially independently scattered thermomechanical sidebands. For pump tones exhibiting large frequency separation, the dynamics is suppressed and accurate quantum noise thermometry demonstrated. We develop a theoretical model based on Floquet theory that accurately describes our observations. The resulting dynamics can be understood as resulting from a synthetic gauge field among the Fourier modes, which is created by the phase lag of the Kerr-type response. This phenomenon has wide-ranging implications for schemes utilizing several pumping tones, as commonly employed in backaction-evading measurements, dissipative optical squeezing, dissipative mechanical squeezing, and quantum noise thermometry. Our observation may equally well be used for optomechanical Floquet engineering, e.g., generation of topological phases of sound by periodic time modulation.","tags":null,"title":"Floquet Dynamics in the Quantum Measurement of Mechanical Motion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Itay Shomroni","Amir Youssefi","Nick Sauerwein","Liu Qiu","Paul Seidler","Daniel Malz","Andreas Nunnenkamp","Tobias J.

Such instabilities have been extensively studied in the context of gravitational wave detectors, and their presence has recently been reported in Advanced LIGO. Here, we observe experimentally and describe theoretically a new type of optomechanical instability that arises in two-tone backaction-evading (BAE) measurements, a protocol designed to overcome the standard quantum limit. We demonstrate the effect in the optical domain with a photonic crystal nanobeam cavity and in the microwave domain with a micromechanical oscillator coupled to a microwave resonator. In contrast to the well-known parametric oscillatory instability that occurs in single-tone, blue-detuned pumping, and results from a two-mode squeezing interaction between the optical and mechanical modes, the parametric instability in balanced two-tone optomechanics results from single-mode squeezing of the mechanical mode in the presence of small detuning errors in the two pump frequencies. Counterintuitively, the instability occurs even in the presence of perfectly balanced intracavity fields and can occur for both signs of detuning errors. We find excellent quantitative agreement with our theoretical predictions. Since the constraints on tuning accuracy become stricter with increasing probe power, the instability imposes a fundamental limitation on BAE measurements as well as other two-tone schemes, such as dissipative squeezing of optical and microwave fields or of mechanical motion. In addition to identifying a new limitation in two-tone BAE measurements, the results also introduce a new type of nonlinear dynamics in cavity optomechanics.","tags":null,"title":"Two-Tone Optomechanical Instability and Its Fundamental Implications for Backaction-Evading Measurements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Itay Shomroni","Liu Qiu","Daniel Malz","Andreas Nunnenkamp","Tobias J.
